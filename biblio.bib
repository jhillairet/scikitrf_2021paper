  abstract = {The author presents a method for the calibration of network analyzers. The essential feature is the use of multiple, redundant transmission line standards. The additional information provided by the redundant standards is used to minimize the effects of random errors, such as those caused by imperfect connector repeatability. The resulting method exhibits improvements in both accuracy and bandwidth over conventional methods. The basis of the statistical treatment is a linearized error analysis of the TRL (thru-reflect-line) calibration method. The analysis presented is useful in the assessment of calibration accuracy. It also yields results relevant to the choice of standards.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The basic philosophy of the through-short-delay (TSD) calibration procedure for two-port automated network analyzers has been extended to n-port scattering-parameter measurements, while also accounting for the errors due to possible signal leakage between all port pairs. The system errors are represented by the scattering response of a 2n-port virtual error network, having n ports connected to the device under test and n ports connected to an ideal error-free multiport network analyzer. The (2n)/sup 2/ T-parameters of the error network are explicitly expressed in blocks of n/sup 2/ at a time, as matricial functions of the 3n/sup 2/ S-parameters of three n-port standards, sequentially replacing the device under test during system calibration. The possibility has also been investigated of correcting the errors due to repeatable measurement-port mismatch changes, typical of switching scattering-parameter test sets. This capability has been introduced and tested in the classical two-port TSD calibration algorithm, by means of a minor modification and data postprocessing, applied after the removal of conventional errors.},
